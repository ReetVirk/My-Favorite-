      <p id = "firstp"> Dragons are my favorite mythical creature because they can be styled in so many different ways. For example, in one book there might be a villian dragon, who is trying to take over the world, and in another, the dragon might be the hero, or a side character who helps the hero. Plus, dragons can be given so many different attributes. One dragon may be able to breathe underwater, while another dragon may shoot flames, and yet another may have no firebreath or water breathing but may be able to camoflauge into any terrain. Dragons are some of the easiest magical creature to put in a book or movie because they can be changed to fit the plot and still be dragons. </p>
